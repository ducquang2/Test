        <p>
            Marvel Studios has released 23 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man (2008) to Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).

      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
          Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
          constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
          class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
          JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
          requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
          loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
          be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
          you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
          function return types are not explicitly typed.

      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
  
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
        names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
        JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
        identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name.

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        You can declare a variable in three ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
          always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
          below.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Production_library">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
          global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
          code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
          context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
          is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
  
        <code
          >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code
        >
